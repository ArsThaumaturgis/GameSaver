1.03 -> 1.5:

 - Increased security when loading--no more use of "eval" or "exec" to provide an attack-vector!

 - Better error-handling, I think.

 - Handling of byte-strings.

 - Movement of example-files into a separate folder, for the sake of better organisation and a clearer delineation between core- and example- files.

 - Minor updates to the example files.

 - Likely further changes, too.

1.02 -> 1.03:

 - The inclusion of a convenience class used to wrap simple objects (dicts, lists, etc.)

1.01 -> 1.02:

 - GameSaver should now handle strings that carry the newline character, thanks to the "str.encode" and "str.decode" methods.

1.0 -> 1.01:

 - All GameSaver classes now descend from "object".

 - GameSaver should now automatically handle various classes that descend from Iterable, not just list, tuple, dict and str.

 - GameSaver should now automatically handle various callable types, not just functions and methods.

 - GameSaver should now pass on IOExceptions produced during saving and loading; these are expected to be handled (or ignored) by the user.
